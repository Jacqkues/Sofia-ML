# Sofia ML

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms in Rust. I developed these projects during my internship at Saint Kliment University in Bulgaria.

## Projects 

- **astar** : Implementation of the A* algorithm to solve the 15-puzzle (taquin) game.
- **tictactoe** :  Implementation of the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to create an unbeatable opponent.
- **genetics** : Implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem.
- **classifier** : Implementation of two classification algorithms on the famous Iris dataset: K-NN Classifier and Naive Bayes Classifier.
- **dfs** : Implementation of the DFS (Depth-First Search) algorithm to solve the frog puzzle.
